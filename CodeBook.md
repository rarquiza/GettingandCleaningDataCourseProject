<center> B. Transformations

1. Merged the activity labels to the activity table into activity_<set_type>
   data frame where <set_type> either "test" or "train".

2. Merged the columns of activity_<set_type> data frame and subject data frame 
   and the measurement data frame.

3. Renamed the columns of the measurement data frame using the names in the
   features.txt data frame. Ensure column names are unique using the 
   make.names function.

4. Merged the rows of the test and train measurements data frames using
   rbind function.

5. Selected the means and standard deviations columns using the dplyr
   package select function. 

6. Extracted the specified independent tidy dataset using the sqldf
   package SQL interface to group the data by activity and subject
   and get the average of the numeric columns.
